  Title:
    Is it a palindrome?

  Desctiption: 
    Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date and time 12/21/33 12:21, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".

function isPalindrome(x) {
  x = x.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "");

  let reversedX = x.split("").reverse().join("");

  return reversedX === x;
